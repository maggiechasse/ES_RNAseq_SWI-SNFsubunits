# Fall2017_Capstone
Fall 2017 capstone for my Genomic Science Independent Study. 
Part A: Recap of the semester.

Summarization of this semester of your independent study and how has/will impact your ongoing research goals and future career
THis semester I learned Python and through intermediate R, including ggplot2 and data cleaning. While the Python language won't necessarily be as helpful for my research, what I have learned in R will impact both my reserach here at Van Andel and my research career. I applied to graduate school with the goal of learning bioinformatics and being comfortable with big data - particularly sequencing data. So far in my indepenent study, I have learned how to manipulate large data sets, clean up data, and plot the data. All of these will be useful in analyzing my own data as well as giving me the tools to learn more bioinformatics in the future. 
1) What were your goals for the independent study this semester? Do you feel as though you were able to accomplish them?
My goals for this semester were to have a working knowledge of R and Python - both of which I feel that I have accomplished. Through this capstone, I feel that I have also accomplished my goal of being comfortable with large data sets and manipulating them in meaningful ways to create figures. 
2) What did you find to be the most challenging aspect of the independent study?
The most challenging aspect of the independent study so far has been switching between Python and R languages. Having focused more on R for the second half of this last semester has helped me focus on the details of each language. An additional challenge has been knowing if I actually understand what I've learned through Coursera and Datacamp or if I can just understand the languages when in those workspaces. This capstone helped me recognize that I am getting more comfortable with R and ggplot2 to mine datasets - something I will use in my own research. 
3) What did you find to be the most rewarding aspect of the independent study?
As I've stated above, the most rewarding aspect of this independent study is learning R and the tools I will need to analyze my own RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.
